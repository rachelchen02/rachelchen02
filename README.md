### Rachel Chen ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior sociology and psychology student at the University of Texas at Austin. 

I am interested in the intersection of sociology and policy, especially in the realm of educational inequalities. I believe that research and data can help inform policy solutions and make the world a more equitable place.
